## University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team Newsletter March 2021

This is the 9th monthly newsletter from
the [Research Software Engineering Team][rses] at The University of Sheffield.
We aim to share our experiences and information of other communities for those using software for research.
This newsletter collects interesting events and opportunities over the coming month.
It also signposts to other resources that we find beneficial or interesting.
You may find the content interesting if you are someone in research using software,
are a person paid to develop software (like a Research Software Engineer (RSE)).
or are somewhere in-between (a *research developer*).

To receive this newsletter as an email each month, please sign up to our [Google Group][rses-mail-list].

*All times are GMT (UTC+00)*


### News

**[The University of Sheffield has released a statement on open research](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/openresearch/university-statement-open-research)**. It officially recognises that making research transparent and freely accessible plays a vital part in promoting research excellence.

The Python language continues to evolve after ~30 years: it's gaining **['pattern matching' functionality](https://lwn.net/Articles/845480/)** similar to what can be found in Rust and functional programming languages such as Haskell and Scala.  This superficially looks like the case/switch statements one gets in languages such as C/C++/Java but offers much richer functionality.


### Resources
