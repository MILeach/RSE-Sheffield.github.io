The Polar Thematic Exploitation Portal ([Polar TEP](https://portal.polartep.io/ssoportal/pages/login.jsf)) is a platform that allows research software to be uploaded and run, accessing a reservoir of satellite imaging data without having to download enormous image files. It enables software to be run interactively by end users using a web graphical user interface, and chained together into workflows.

Software for tracking the sea ice edge and icebergs had previously been written using [MatLab](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). In order to be deployed on Polar TEP, this needed to be converted into Python and made to run in a Docker container.

Tracking sea ice is of global concern in the context of climate change research, but also of immediate use in shipping and coastal economic activity in the polar regions.
