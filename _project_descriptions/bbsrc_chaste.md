Development project contributing to the development and optimisation of the [Chaste](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/cell_based_index.html) cell modelling software. In particular, the addition a new feature allowing ODE systems to be simulated for each cell-edge, the use of OpenMP for taking advantage of multiple CPU cores and a tool for scheduling parameter sweeping on the HPC. The RSES team worked to integrate the development workflow within the established and well-tested code ecosystem.
