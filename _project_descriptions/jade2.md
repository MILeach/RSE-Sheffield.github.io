JADE II is a GPU-based, deep Learning focused, Tier-2 HPC system associated with 19 academic partners including Sheffield. It is the successor of the [JADE](http://www.jade.ac.uk/) system due to be decommissioned in 2021.

RSES is a local institutional contact and is involved in promoting the system, managing user access and on-boarding, provide on-going technical support and training. 

In order to train users and promote the use of the system, RSES have created an [Introduction to Deep Learning Course](https://rses-dl-course.github.io/), a one-day mixture of theoretical lectures and practical labs in Python and R.
