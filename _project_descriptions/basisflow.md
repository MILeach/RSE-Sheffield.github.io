[Basisflow](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T027134/1) is a computational chemistry project headed by [Dr. Grant Hill](http://www.grant-hill.group.shef.ac.uk/) that aims to apply machine learning approach to the generation of basis sets, mathematical functions used in the representation of atomic and molecular orbitals. RSES is providing support and consultancy on the possible ML approaches and the methods to fully utilise available HPC systems.
