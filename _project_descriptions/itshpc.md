The University operates [several high-performance computing (HPC) clusters](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/)
available for use by all research students and staff and 
facilitates access to specialist, multi-institution (HPC) clusters.

The RSE team has collaborated with [IT Services](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/) on improving and maintaining these computing facilities over several years.  Some outputs of this work include:

* A [JupyterHub on the ShARC HPC cluster](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/hpc/jupyterhub.html),
  which allows researchers to run [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) on 
* A [means for ring-fencing GPU resources](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/sge-gpulock2/)
  (and avoiding GPU memory contention issues)
  when running GPU jobs on HPC systems that use the 
  [Son of Grid Engine](https://arc.liv.ac.uk/trac/SGE) job scheduler / distributed resource manager.
* Other aspects of provisioning and management of GPU resources in the University's HPC clusters 
* Improvements to automated configuration management, resource monitoring and alerting capabilities.

This partnership has also resulted in greater visibility of certain HPC user needs through the 
RSE team being involved in a number of projects across the University.
