[RISIS II](https://www.risis2.eu/) is an EU Horizon 2020 project building on the previous RISIS project (Research Infrastructure for Science and Innovation Policy Studies) to provide infrastructure for analysis and availability of data on research and innovation.

The RISIS project makes use of text analytic pipelines build on the [GATE](http://gate.ac.uk/) framework and the RSE team collaborated with the GATE team to build containerised versions of these analyses for use by the RISIS core framework.
