[PyKale](https://github.com/pykale/pykale) is a ([PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based) Python package aimed at standardising machine learning workflows for graphs, images, and videos with a unified pipeline-based API to accelerate cross-disciplinary research. This package also makes it easier for end-users to access machine learning. An important target audience are clinicians and clinical researchers who have abundant data to analyse, but lack the time and expertise to apply machine learning approaches. The work is supported by the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/innovator-awards-digital-technologies).

A key RSE involvement in the project to date was the development of a documented strategy to add automated testing to the package. We also advise on the use of version control and collaboration via GitHub, as well as static analysis, release mechanisms and packaging.

Machine learning has the potential to improve diagnosis, prognosis and selection of treatment, improving health and quality of life for patients. A key example is analysis of medical imaging data to identify unusual features that may be of clinical interest. Lack of expertise and governance barriers to transferring data from clinical organisations can mean that adoption of machine learning is reduced. This easily-accessible machine learning package will bring machine learning software closer to clinicians for improved clinical outcomes powered by AI.
