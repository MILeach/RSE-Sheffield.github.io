[RateSetter](https://www.rssb.co.uk/en/research-catalogue/CatalogueItem/COF-PTI-04) is an [RSSB](https://www.rssb.co.uk/)-funded project that aims to create a software for predicting and optimising passenger flow at the Platform Train Interface (PTI). The project resulted in the publication of the paper [RateSetter: roadmap for faster, safer, and better platform train interface design and operation using evolutionary optimisation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3205455.3205605). 

RSE was involved in the creation of the [FLAME GPU](http://www.flamegpu.com/)-based pedestrian model that simulates passengers boarding and alighting the train which is used as a basis for predicting the results of changes in the train layout during the optimisation exploration process.
