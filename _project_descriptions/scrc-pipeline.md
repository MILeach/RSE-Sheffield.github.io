Following work on developing covid-19 models as part of the [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/) Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic ([RAMP](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/Health%20and%20wellbeing/ramp/)) initiative, a need was identified to be able to track the provenance of epidemiological model outputs in order to build trust from politicians, academics, the media and members of the public. This entails building on the Scottish Covid Response Consortium's ([SCRC](https://scottishcovidresponse.github.io/)) data pipeline which comprises a database and APIs to allow epidemiological modelling software to:

- Access version-controlled data needed to inform simulations.
- Record the output of model runs such that software version and input data provenance is traceable.

RSE involvement contributes to consortium strategy and leadership of the software API development work in an Agile mindset. RSE will also be involved with developing the Python data pipeline API.

The output of this project will enable epidemiologists to manage data better and deliver improved advice based on more traceable software and data versioning. This will extend beyond the current covid epidemic into future human and animal disease outbreaks.
