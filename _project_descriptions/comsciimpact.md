Working with a number of research projects in the Department of Computer Science, the RSE team have worked with researchers to enhance the research impact of projects identified for REF impact case studies.

Some of these have included:

**GATEcloud usage statistics**

Few research software projects measure their own usage, but data demonstrating impact can be essential to gaining future funding for software. GATE is a software framework for text analytics, developed by the Natural Language Processing group. A large number of analytic pipelines are available via API calls to the widely-used [GATEcloud](https://cloud.gate.ac.uk/) service.

The RSE team worked with GATE to build a simple tool to regularly analyse the usage of these services and make up to date statistics available internally for use in funding applications and reports.


**DeepQuest**

A neural network-based tool for quality estimation in machine translation. The RSE team worked with researchers to refactor a proof of principle codebase which demonstrated excellent results in using deep learning to estimate the quality of linguistic translations. The impact of the project was enhanced by refactoring the codebase in order to create a Python package, developing command line  and Python interfaces, reducing the size of the codebase and adding tests and documentation.
