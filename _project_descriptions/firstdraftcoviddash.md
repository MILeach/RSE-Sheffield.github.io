During the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, [First Draft](http://firstdraftnews.org/) worked with researchers in the [GATE team](http://gate.ac.uk/) to analyse the availability and demand of fact checking in various areas of misinformation relating to COVID-19.

The RSE team worked with GATE RSEs to build a [data visualisation dashboard](https://datadeficits.firstdraftnews.org/) to provide data visualisation and analysis for this research.

The dashboard calculates and visualises the geographic spread of availability of fact checking vs demand on different topics of misinformation. As well as providing interactive components showing indicators for information demand and information supply.

It was developed using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework with a front-end implemented in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

The visualisations and analysis made available by this dashboard helped to inform researchers at First Draft on the supply and demand for media fact checking relating to the pandemic and a report on their findings was [written up here](https://firstdraftnews.org/long-form-article/data-deficits/).
