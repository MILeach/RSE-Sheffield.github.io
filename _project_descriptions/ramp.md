Early in the covid-19 epidemic the [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/) began the Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic ([RAMP](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/Health%20and%20wellbeing/ramp/)) initiative to bring together epidemiological modelling and supporting expertise to provide advice to government. This led to the formation of the Scottish Covid Response Consortium ([SCRC](https://scottishcovidresponse.github.io/)) comprising members from over 30 organisations in academia and the private sector, with skills spanning epidemiology, software engineering, data management, policy / media engagement and visualisation. SCRC has produced multiple high quality pieces of epidemiological modelling software in a variety of programming languages, and a data pipeline system for rapid, reproducible outputs.

The University of Sheffield contributed an RSE to provide software engineering leadership on the [Simple Network Sim](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/simple_network_sim) epidemiological modelling software. This entailed collaborating with the epidemiological modelling lead and co-ordinating the efforts of software engineers and data scientists (largely volunteered by the [Man Group](https://www.man.com/)) using an Agile project management approach. The work was carried out against the background of media coverage of government policy informed by imperfect research software, so a key part of what we did was to help define and ensure software quality. This resulted in the development of an epidemiological modelling [software checklist](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/modelling-resources/blob/main/software-checklist.md).

Whilst of limited direct input to government policy, SCRC has set a new standard for open epidemiological modelling, which will, by example, drive future policy-informing research to be more open and reproducible. This gives organisations the technical and scientific foundation to behave in a trustworthy way when using evidence from epidemiological models.
