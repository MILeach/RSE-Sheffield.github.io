#### Join us for a ReproHack on Tues 9th March 2021. Pick a paper, try and reproduce its results and provide valuable feedback to the author(s).**

### About the event

Reproducibility is a fundamental aspect of research. With the increasing complexity of modern research processes, ensuring results are easily reproducible is an area that has become increasingly high-profile.

The growth in open data and open source software and the wide array of platforms available to facilitate sharing of data and code mean that reproducing results of research based on open source software and data should be more straightforward than ever before.

Is this actually the case? Join us on **Tuesday 9th March, 10:00-17:00** to decide for yourself!

At this [ReproHack](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/) event you'll have the opportunity to work alone or as part of group to select a paper from a directory of contributed publications and try to reproduce the results.

### What is a ReproHack?

A ReproHack - reproducibility hackathon - is an event where participants aim to reproduce scientific results detailed in published papers. Workshop participants choose a paper and then have time to work alone, or as part of a group, to try and understand the paper and to reproduce its results, from published code and data. There are reporting back sessions during the day to give you an opportunity to update the organisers and other participants on your progress, and to get hints and tips to help you achieve your goal.

A ReproHack is a low-pressure environment that provides participants with the opportunity to work with real-world data and research software. It also provides the opportunity to network and learn from other researchers, RSEs and software engineers with a range of different technical and research experience.

The aim of a ReproHack is absolutely not to undermine or discredit researchers or their work. Researchers who have submitted papers to the ReproHack have voluntarily offered to have their work considered as part of the event because they understand the importance of reproducibility and are keen to learn from the feedback and advice you may be able to offer. This will help the authors of submitted papers to enhance their research outputs and to develop more reproducible research and publications in the future. We hope that you will also gain similar benefits by participating in this workshop.

### Submitting a paper for consideration

Whether or not you plan to attend the workshop, you can still submit a paper and associated code and data to be included in the directory of available publications for participants to choose from.

**You can submit a paper via this form:** [https://forms.gle/A3tvyU7GCXJh474W8](https://forms.gle/A3tvyU7GCXJh474W8)

When submitting a paper, you will need to provide the following information:

 - Your name, the paper title and where it was published
 - An explanation of why we should attempt to reproduce this paper
 - URLs for the paper, data and code
 - A list of programming skills that would be useful to reproduce the paper


You can choose whether you want to receive feedback from anyone who attempts to reproduce your paper.

If you are keen to submit a paper but have questions, please contact Jeremy Cohen (jeremy.cohenATimperial.ac.uk).

### How does it work?

We'll begin the workshop with a brief introduction to the collaboration environment we'll be using, followed by a short "icebreaker" exercise providing an opportunity to meet other attendees.

We'll then have a talk from a guest speaker **Dr Sarah Gibson** ***(Turing Institute)*** on a ***Sharing Reproducible Computational Environments with Binder***.

The first hour will conclude with an introduction to the ReproHack process itself and some details on how to go about selecting a suitable paper and reviewing and attempting to reproduce its results.

Following this, the ReproHack will begin with taking a look at the list of papers available to choose from, forming groups and selecting a paper to work on. We'll break for coffee and the ReproHacking will begin!

There will be the opportunity to work in online breakout rooms as part of a group, or to remain in a main space and work independently. There will also be a virtual coffee space where you can gather to chat with other participants.

During the day, there will be a lunch break and coffee breaks scheduled along with specific times scheduled to come together as a complete group and report back on progress to the other participants. We will also schedule a couple of short talks during the day to give you some thoughts and ideas on reproducibility-related topics or experiences to help you as part of your analysis.
