The first user group meeting for those with an interest in using the [Bede](https://n8cir.org.uk/supporting-research/facilities/nice/) GPU-equipped high-performance computing cluster.

Note that all Research Software Engineers supporting Bede are automatically part of the Bede User Group, as they act as a focus lens to bring in the views of the researchers they work with.

If you would like connection details for the Zoom call and/or want to be added to the Bede User Group mailing list then [follow the instructions here](https://n8cir.org.uk/contact/).
