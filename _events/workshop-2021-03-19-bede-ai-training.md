In this second workshop, Ludo Enault will discuss and advise on Bede's data science tools.

Bede's unique GPU-accelerated architecture makes it ideal for AI and machine learning research using well-known common frameworks.
However there are also exclusive IBM toolsets that further this advantage.

This workshop will cover:

  * Utilising Large Model Support with extended datasets
  * Using SNAPML to accelerate larger machine learning jobs
  * Spreading workloads across multiple GPUs and nodes

There will be plenty of time for questions and discussion about how best to run your code on Bede.

This session is only open to those working or studying at one of the N8 universities.
When registering for this event, please use your academic (`.ac.uk`) e-mail address.
