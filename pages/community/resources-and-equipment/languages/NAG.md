## NAG Library

The NAG (Numerical Algorithms Group) library is
a large collection of tried and tested numerical subroutines
which may be called from within your own programs.
The library is provided in a variety of languages
(including MATLAB, C, Fortran and Python)
and for a variety of hardware platforms.
The University has a full site license for all staff and students.

Documentation for the NAG Library on the University's [ShARC](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/sharc/software/libs/nag-libs.html) high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.

## NAG Fortran Compiler

According to the [2015 Fortran UK compiler comparisons](https://www.fortran.uk/fortran-compiler-comparisons/intellinux-fortran-compiler-diagnostic-capabilities/),
the NAG compiler was one of the best diagnostic compilers available.
The University has a full site license for all staff and students.
